(explain all of them using a single program and also short program separately for each of them).

## Response:
Here's a **5-mark worthy answer** that explains each directory method clearly, concisely, and technically using **Python's `os` module**.

* * *

### **Directory Methods in Python**

Python provides several directory-related methods in the `os` module:

* * *

### ✅ **1\. `mkdir()`**

Creates a **single** new directory.

**Example:**

```python
import os
os.mkdir("new_folder")
```

* * *

### ✅ **2\. `getcwd()`**

Returns the **current working directory** as a string.

**Example:**

```python
import os
print("Current Directory:", os.getcwd())
```

* * *

### ✅ **3\. `chdir()`**

Changes the **current working directory** to the given path.

**Example:**

```python
import os
os.chdir("new_folder")
print("Changed Directory:", os.getcwd())
```

* * *

### ✅ **4\. `rmdir()`**

Removes an **empty directory**.

**Example:**

```python
import os
os.rmdir("new_folder")
```

* * *

### ✅ **5\. `makedirs()`**

Creates a directory **along with intermediate directories**.

**Example:**

```python
import os
os.makedirs("parent_dir/child_dir")
```

* * *

### ✅ **Combined Example Using All Methods**

```python
import os

# 1. Print current directory
print("Original:", os.getcwd())

# 2. Create a directory
os.mkdir("example_dir")

# 3. Change to new directory
os.chdir("example_dir")
print("After chdir:", os.getcwd())

# 4. Create nested directories
os.makedirs("nested1/nested2")

# 5. Go back and remove created directories
os.chdir("..")
os.rmdir("example_dir")  # Only works if it's empty
```

* * *

### 🔚 Conclusion:

These functions help in creating, navigating, and deleting directories in Python using the `os` module.

Let me know the next question!

## Prompt:
Explain relative and absolute path of a file. 

(Explain with a example program at the end to make it clear to the paper checker)

## Response:
Here’s a clear, concise, and technical **5-mark answer** for:

* * *

### **Relative and Absolute Path in File Handling**

In Python, file paths can be specified using **relative** or **absolute** paths.

* * *

### ✅ **1\. Absolute Path**

An absolute path is the **complete path** from the root directory to the target file.

*   It starts from the **drive letter** (Windows) or **root `/`** (Linux/Mac).
    
*   It always points to the **same file**, regardless of the current working directory.
    

**Example:**

```python
"C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\file.txt"   # Windows  
"/home/user/Documents/file.txt"          # Linux/Mac
```

* * *

### ✅ **2\. Relative Path**

A relative path is **relative to the current working directory** (returned by `os.getcwd()`).

*   It's **shorter** and **portable**.
    
*   Depends on the **location of the Python script**.
    

**Example:**

```python
"data/file.txt"      # Means 'file.txt' is inside 'data' folder
"../file.txt"        # Means one directory up
```

* * *

### ✅ **Example Program:**

```python
import os

# Absolute Path
abs_path = "C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\file.txt"
print("Absolute Path:", abs_path)

# Relative Path
rel_path = "data\\file.txt"
print("Relative Path:", os.path.abspath(rel_path))
```

**Output:**

```
Absolute Path: C:\Users\User\Documents\file.txt  
Relative Path: C:\Users\User\CurrentFolder\data\file.txt
```

* * *

### 🔚 Conclusion:

*   **Absolute path**: Full fixed location of a file
    
*   **Relative path**: Based on current working directory  
    Understanding both is essential for flexible file handling.

num1 = int(sys.argv[1])
num2 = int(sys.argv[2])
print("Sum:", num1 + num2)
```

* * *

### ✅ **How to Run:**

If the file name is `add.py`, run it in terminal:

```
python add.py 10 20
```

**Output:**

```
Sum: 30
```

Don't use count, use a loop and check with if statement. Keep the program simple and short. Keep the program similar in structure so It's easier to understand the logic -

Write python program to count the total number of blank spaces in the file.

Write a python program to count the total number of words and characters in a file.

Write a program that counts the number of tabs and new line characters in File.

## Response:
Here are the **three simple, short, and logically similar Python programs** using loops and `if` conditions as per your instructions:

* * *

### ✅ **1\. Count the Total Number of Blank Spaces in a File**

```python
f = open("sample.txt", "r")
space_count = 0

for ch in f.read():
    if ch == ' ':
        space_count += 1

print("Total spaces:", space_count)
f.close()
```

* * *

### ✅ **2\. Count the Total Number of Words and Characters in a File**

```python
f = open("sample.txt", "r")
word_count = 0
char_count = 0

for line in f:
    for ch in line:
        if ch != ' ' and ch != '\n':
            char_count += 1
    word_count += len(line.split())

print("Total words:", word_count)
print("Total characters:", char_count)
f.close()
```

* * *

### ✅ **3\. Count the Number of Tabs and New Line Characters in a File**

```python
f = open("sample.txt", "r")
tab_count = 0
newline_count = 0

for ch in f.read():
    if ch == '\t':
        tab_count += 1
    if ch == '\n':
        newline_count += 1

print("Total tabs:", tab_count)
print("Total newlines:", newline_count)
f.close()
```

* * *

These programs follow the same structure:

### ✅ **Python Program to Count Vowels and Consonants in a File**

```python
f = open("sample.txt", "r")
vowels = 0
consonants = 0

for ch in f.read():
    ch = ch.lower()
    if ch.isalpha():
        if ch in 'aeiou':
            vowels += 1
        else:
            consonants += 1

print("Total vowels:", vowels)
print("Total consonants:", consonants)
f.close()
```

* * *

### 🔍 **Logic:**

*   `ch.isalpha()` checks if the character is a letter
    
*   If it's a vowel (`a, e, i, o, u`) → count as vowel
    
*   Else → count as consonant
    

This keeps the structure consistent with your previous programs.

Let me know the next one!

## Prompt:
Write a program to read the first 10 characters from the file and display it.

Write a program to copy the contents of one file to another file

Write a program that reads text from a file and writes in into another file but in the reverse order.

## Response:
Here are the **three simple and structured Python programs** as per your request, using basic file handling and logic:

* * *

### ✅ **1\. Read the First 10 Characters from a File**

```python
f = open("sample.txt", "r")
data = f.read(10)
print("First 10 characters:", data)
f.close()
```

* * *

### ✅ **2\. Copy Contents of One File to Another**

```python
src = open("source.txt", "r")
dest = open("destination.txt", "w")

for line in src:
    dest.write(line)

print("File copied successfully.")
src.close()
dest.close()
```

* * *

### ✅ **3\. Read Text from a File and Write It in Reverse Order to Another File**

```python
src = open("sample.txt", "r")
dest = open("reversed.txt", "w")

data = src.read()
dest.write(data[::-1])

print("Reversed content written to file.")
src.close()
dest.close()
```

* * *

These programs are short, simple, and follow the same structured logic to help you remember easily for the exam.
